# Project Planner

Users will be able to create new projects to be planned. Each project will be seperated into phases(Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, etc...). Each phase will contain actions that can be seperated into "Todo", "In Progress", and "Completed". Projects of any type will be supported but the current plan is to add Github support through the Github API to sync with a user's Github project.
